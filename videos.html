        <h1>Love is the answer - Natalie Taylor</h1>
<p>
 I know what it's like
I know how it feels
Let the pain break you down
Now you gotta give it time to heal
Don't worry now
Even though the fear is real
Just hold on
</p>

<p>
If you're looking for a sign
Something to carry you back into the light
Love is the answer
Love is the answer
When you're ready, start again
I'll be here waiting reaching out my hands
Love is the answer
Love is the answer
</p>

<p>
I know it's a struggle
I know it's a fight
Not to end every day feeling like you've been living a lie
It's time to be free
It's time to find peace by the water
And just hold on
</p>

<p>
If you're looking for a sign
Something to carry you back into the light
Love is the answer
Love is the answer
When you're ready, start again
I'll be here waiting reaching out my hands
Love is the answer
Love is the answer
</p>

<p>
Love is the answer
Love is the answer
</p>

<p>
If you're looking for a sign
Something to carry you back into the light
Love is the answer
Love is the answer
When you're ready, start again
I'll be here waiting reaching out my hands
Love is the answer
Love is the answer
</p>


<p>
Just hold on
<br>
Just hold on
